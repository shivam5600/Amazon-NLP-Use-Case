# Sentiment Identification

## BACKGROUND
A large multinational corporation is seeking to automatically identify the sentiment that their customer base talks
about on social media. They would like to expand this capability into multiple languages. Many 3rd party tools exist for
sentiment analysis, however, they need help with under-resourced languages.

## GOAL

Train a sentiment classifier (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on a corpus of the provided documents. Your goal is to
maximize accuracy. There is special interest in being able to accurately detect negative sentiment. The training data
includes documents from a wide variety of sources, not merely social media, and some of it may be inconsistently
labeled. Please describe the business outcomes in your work sample including how data limitations impact your results
and how these limitations could be addressed in a larger project.
